       <p>The lightsaber, also referred to as a laser sword by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the Jedi, Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consisted of a plasma blade, powered by a kyber crystal, that was emitted from a usually metal hilt and could be shut off at will.</p> 
         <p>It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from flesh to blast doors.</li>
           <li>Lightsaber combat was divided into seven Forms: Form I, Form II, Form III, Form IV, Form V, Form VI, and Form VII.</li>
           </ul>
           <code>The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as an electrostaff, a Z6 riot control baton, some rare metals like beskar, or another lightsaber. </code>

       <p>The diatium power cell, also known as a diatium power core, was a power source. They were suitable to be used as the primary power source in lightsabers.</p>
       <code>The first lightsaber Obi-Wan Kenobi wielded as a Jedi used one, which was surrounded by the notched hand grip. Darth Vader's lightsaber used a high-output diatium power cell. Vader's grandson, Ben Solo, also used a lightsaber with a bronze-colored diatium power cell cradled in its handle during his Jedi training with Luke Skywalker's reborn Jedi Order and after his fall to the dark side as Kylo Ren. Other than lightsabers, power cells can be used in other weaponry, such as Jannah's energy bow.</code>

       <p>A kyber crystal, simply known as a kyber and described as a lightsaber crystal or the living crystal, was a rare, Force-attuned crystal that grew naturally and was found on various planets across the galaxy.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Through an unspecified process involving being placed in a furnace and hammering, kyber crystals could be tempered to match with the nature of multiple individuals multiple times, beside bonding with just one for life. </li>
         <li>When these tempered crystals are placed within a weapon such as a lightsaber, its color will change within moments upon being picked up by a new wielder.</li>
         </ul>
         <code>Kyber crystals were most notably found in Ilum's Crystal Cave. They were a critical component in the construction of lightsabers, focusing energy into the weapon's distinct plasma blade.</code>
         <code>Kyber crystals are rare gems capable of focusing and amplifying energy. They can be found on planets that have a high natural concentration of Force energy, such as Jedha and Ilum.</code>

       <article>
       <p>A focusing lens was a technological component used in weapons.[1] It is primary known as a key component in the construction of a lightsaber hilt. These lenses further regulated the beam of a lightsaber, allowing the blade it produced to terminate at a given point. Different types of lenses yielded different properties in the lightsabers that they were built into; in addition, like most other parts of these weapons, they required skilled craftsbeings to produce though often they were available commercially or even salvageable.</p>

       <p>Cycling field energizers were a type of lightsaber component, mounted above the kyber crystal and below the energy modulation circuits. Energy modulation circuits were a type of lightsaber component, mounted below the focusing lens and above the cycling field energizers.</p>

       <section class="main-section" id="Blade_Intensity_and_Length_Adjustment"><header>Blade Intensity and Length Adjustment</header>
       <article>
       <p>The plasma was projected through a set of lightsaber crystals that lent the blade its properties and allowed for the adjustment of blade length and power output. The ideal number of crystals was three, though only one was required. A power insulator was installed on the hilt to protect the wielder from any energy discharges. Activating the lightsaber usually required a button of some sort. A blade power adjustment knob was sometimes installed to allow the wielder to vary the power of the blade. A discharge energy cell could also be installed to increase a lightsaber's power output.</p>
       <code>Once focused by the crystals, the plasma was sent through a series of field energizers and modulation circuitry within the emitter matrix that further focused it, making it into a coherent beam of energy that was projected from the blade emitter.</code>

       <p>A stabilizing ring was a component used in lightsabers. The Skywalker lightsaber had a magnetic stabilizing ring.</p>

       <article>
       <p>An emitter matrix was a device that could be added to a lightsaber. It improved use against droids.[1] Inverting the emitter matrix would cause the lightsaber to backfire and explode, potentially killing anybody in the vicinity.</p>

       <article>
       <p>Lightsaber hilts were the basic, all-encompassing part of a lightsaber. A combination handgrip, blade emitter, activator switch and power source, it held within the inner workings of the weapon that allowed it to produce its distinctive energy-based blade.</p>
       <p>A lightsaber hilt contained many components, all of which were hand-selected by the Force-user who constructed it and tuned to be in harmony with each other at the completion of the weapon's creation. From focusing lens to pommel cap, such components typically included a blade emitter shroud, magnetic stabilizing loop followed by a ring tuning flange to ensure that the activated blade did not in turn burn through the hilt. Immediately below and mounted internally lay the blade arc tip, followed on the outside by the blade power adjustment and blade length adjustment knobs.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Both the Jedi and the Sith Order used lightsaber hilts; the former regarding them as tools rather than weapons, while the latter sought to use their sabers to fuel their quest for power.</li>
         <li>While the individual components of a lightsaber were relatively common and could be mass-produced, aligning them and the crystals required a supernaturally-steady hand guided by the Force. No attempt to mass-produce lightsabers ever succeeded.</li>
         </ul>
         <code>Following the arc tip were mounted the blade energy channel which was nested amongst the cycling field energizers. Within the crystal energy chamber below this lay the focusing crystals, the focusing crystal activator and the primary crystal which was attached to the primary crystal mount and situated between the lightsaber energy gate.</code>

       <article>
       <p>The activation stud, button, slide, switch, lever, or plate, was a component on the hilt of a lightsaber or lightwhip that activated the weapon's energy blade. It was generally a prominent button, although Asajj Ventress concealed the activation switches on her lightsabers.[2]</p>
